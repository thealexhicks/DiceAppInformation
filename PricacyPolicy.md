## Dice: Privacy Policy
### Introduction
My name is Alexander Hicks, and I designed “Dice” to be a simple, high-quality, physics-based dice roller.

Dice is both free, and ad-free. The app does not collect any user data, nor does it require any special device permissions, which makes this an easy policy to write.
### Data collected by the app
Dice does not collect any user data, nor does it have any kind of online functionality. Your settings and preferences are stored locally on your device, and can be deleted by uninstalling Dice, or by clearing the app’s data.
### Permissions required by the app
Dice requires no special permissions or access to your device. Dice is designed to be as simple and self-contained as possible.
### Marketing and Advertising
As previously stated, Dice is both free and add-free. I have no ability to contact my users directly or indirectly, and will never send you marketing information or advertisements.
### Contact Information
I respect my users and their privacy. If you see any indication that my app does otherwise, or encounter any kind of security vulnerability of which I am unaware, please don’t hesitate to contact me at alex.k.hicks@gmail.com.

Thanks, and happy rolling,

Alexander Hicks
